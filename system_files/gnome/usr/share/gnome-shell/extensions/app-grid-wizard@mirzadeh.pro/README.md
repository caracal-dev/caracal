# App Grid Wizard - GNOME Extension

A GNOME Shell extension that auto-organizes your app grid into sensible folders and keeps it tidy over time — while preserving a safe, one-click restore to your original layout.

## Features

- One-click organize: creates 13 curated folders (Accessories, Games, Graphics, Internet, …)
- Non-destructive by design: snapshot of your current folders and app layout on first enable
- Manual Restore: restores both folders and app layout to the pre-extension state
- Quick Settings integration: toggle + menu with Restore and Settings
- Auto-compaction: resets `app-picker-layout` so GNOME auto-paginates compactly
- Watches app changes: re-applies folder config when apps are installed/removed (debounced)
- GNOME 45–50

---

## Installation

### From extensions.gnome.org
1. Visit the [App Grid Wizard page on extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7867/app-grid-wizard/).
2. Click the toggle to install.
3. Log out and back in.

### Manual installation
```bash
# 1) Get the code
git clone https://github.com/MahdiMirzadeh/app-grid-wizard.git
cd app-grid-wizard

# 2) Package and install (with translations)
# Package with translations from po/ using GNOME's recommended tool
# Run from the extension root directory

gnome-extensions pack --podir=po
# This produces: app-grid-wizard@mirzadeh.pro.shell-extension.zip

gnome-extensions install app-grid-wizard@mirzadeh.pro.shell-extension.zip --force

# 3) Enable
gnome-extensions enable app-grid-wizard@mirzadeh.pro
# Then log out and back in
```

## Translations (i18n)

- Included languages: English, Russian (ru), Persian/Farsi (fa)
- Packaging above already bundles translations via `--podir=po` and `gettext-domain` in `metadata.json`

Add or update a translation:
1. Edit or add a PO file in `po/`, e.g. `po/fa.po`
2. Keep placeholders and punctuation intact (e.g. ellipsis …)
3. Rebuild: `gnome-extensions pack --podir=po`
4. Reinstall: `gnome-extensions install app-grid-wizard@mirzadeh.pro.shell-extension.zip --force`

Testing translations:
- Change your system language in **GNOME Settings → Region & Language**, add Persian (or your target language), and set it as default.
- Log out and back in.
- Both preferences and Shell UI (Quick Settings, menus) will show the translated strings.
- Note: Using `LC_ALL` on the command line does **not** work for GNOME extensions because the Extensions app and GNOME Shell are D-Bus activated and don't inherit shell environment variables.

---

## Usage

- After installing, enable the extension in the Extensions app to add **App Grid Wizard** to GNOME **Quick Settings**.
- Open Quick Settings and toggle **App Grid Wizard** ON to create folders and compact the layout.
- If you prefer, you can hide the Quick Settings button and control the extension entirely from Preferences.
- Toggle OFF → extension stops monitoring (folders remain).
- Quick Settings ▸ Restore Original Layout → restores snapshot (folders + layout) and turns the extension OFF.
- Preferences ▸ per-folder toggles + Restore button (also turns the extension OFF).

Note: After Restore, log out/in to ensure the app grid fully reflects changes.

## Technical details

This extension changes only GSettings — no private Shell APIs.

### Data model (GSettings)
- App folders: `org.gnome.desktop.app-folders`
  - Key: `folder-children` (as)
  - Per-folder schema: `org.gnome.desktop.app-folders.folder` at path `/org/gnome/desktop/app-folders/folders/<id>/`
    - Keys used: `name` (s), `categories` (as), `apps` (as)
  - Managed IDs: `agw-*` only (e.g. `agw-internet`)
- App grid layout: `org.gnome.shell`
  - Key: `app-picker-layout` (aa{sv}) — snapshot/restore; empty `[]` lets GNOME auto-pack
- Extension state: `org.gnome.shell.extensions.app-grid-wizard`
  - `enabled` (b)
  - `snapshot-taken` (b)
  - `original-folder-children` (as)
  - `original-app-layout` (aa{sv})
  - Per-folder booleans: `folder-accessories`, `folder-games`, …

### Behavior spec (contract)
- On first enable when `snapshot-taken=false`:
  1. Snapshot `folder-children` → `original-folder-children`
  2. Snapshot `app-picker-layout` → `original-app-layout`
- Apply (enable or folder pref change):
  1. Compute enabled `agw-*` IDs
  2. Set `folder-children = <enabled agw IDs>` (replaces non-AGW for compactness)
  3. Write each folder’s `name`/`categories`, plus explicit `apps` for Chrome/Chromium app launchers
  4. Set `app-picker-layout = []` (deferred 300ms) to force compact pages
- Restore (Quick Menu or Prefs):
  1. Write `folder-children = original-folder-children`
  2. After 200ms, set `app-picker-layout = original-app-layout` if non-empty, else `[]`
  3. Set `enabled=false`, `snapshot-taken=false`
- Toggle OFF: stop monitoring; do not remove folders (non-destructive)

### Events / timers
- Listen: `Shell.AppSystem::installed-changed`
- Debounce: 2000ms before re-apply
- Layout writes: 200–300ms after folder changes to avoid grid races

### Logging (grep with journalctl)
- Tag prefix: `App-Grid-Wizard:`
- Examples: `Folders applied`, `Snapshot saved`, `Layout set to [] for auto-pagination`

### Invariants
- Only `agw-*` folder IDs are created/managed by the extension
- Restore never writes non-snapshotted data
- No private GNOME Shell APIs are called

### File layout
- `extension.js` – runtime logic, Quick Settings toggle and menu
- `prefs.js` – Adw preferences window
- `schemas/org.gnome.shell.extensions.app-grid-wizard.gschema.xml` – extension keys
- `metadata.json` – UUID `app-grid-wizard@mirzadeh.pro`

### Debugging quick reference
```bash
# Read current folders
gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.app-folders folder-children

# Read layout (non-empty means manual layout exists)
gsettings get org.gnome.shell app-picker-layout

# Force compact layout
gsettings set org.gnome.shell app-picker-layout '[]'

# Watch logs
journalctl /usr/bin/gnome-shell -f | grep "App-Grid-Wizard"
```

### Limitations
- GNOME always lists folders before apps; interleaving is not supported
- No explicit uninstall hook — use Restore, then disable/uninstall
- Chrome Apps detection depends on Chrome/Chromium app launchers exposing a `.desktop` ID and `--app` or `--app-id` in their launcher command

## Troubleshooting

- First page shows a single stray app? The extension now sets `app-picker-layout` to `[]` after changes; log out/in once if it persists.
- Want your original layout back? Use Restore (Quick Settings or Preferences), then log out/in.
- Translations not showing?
  - Rebuild with `gnome-extensions pack --podir=po` and reinstall.
  - Ensure `metadata.json` has `"gettext-domain": "app-grid-wizard"`.
  - Ensure the locale exists: `locale -a | grep -i fa_IR` (if missing, generate `fa_IR.UTF-8`).
  - Preferences: fully quit the Extensions app before relaunching with `LC_ALL`/`LANG`.
  - Shell UI: on Wayland log out/in; on Xorg use Alt+F2 → `r`.
